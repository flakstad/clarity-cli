# Clarity CLI docs

V1 is local-first and terminal-first:
- CLI for agents/scripting (stable JSON)
- TUI for humans (Bubble Tea)
- Persistence in a local store dir (workspace-first under `~/.clarity/workspaces/<name>/`, or `--dir <path>`)

Start here: `README.md`, then use `clarity docs` and `clarity <command> --help`.

## Design notes (work in progress)

- `docs/design/outline-as-document.md` (planned work for `item-77v`)
